As a more proactive way to engage with the games I thought I’d explore how to integrate predictive modelling with betting strategies.\nStatistical models are common place amongst bookmakers, and I’m not naive enough to believe that a model I threw together over a few days as a hobby could beat a concerted effort by a team of experienced sports analysts. I first developed this project for the 2019 Track Cycling World Championships, but it turned out UK bookmakers weren’t offering odds, let alone those derived from machine learning: so that gives me hope that a team of dedicated track cyling modelers simply doesn’t exist!\nI’m tentatively optimistic odds will be available, after all the olympics. It’d be particularly fitting given cycling betting is one of only four legal betting markets in Japan.\nThis article/mini-documentary depicts the cultural significance of track cycling in Japan.\nIn this post I’ll provide a brief introduction to the event I’m hoping to bet on, and the base statistical model which for my betting strategy.\nSubsequent posts will refine the model through feature engineering, and then derive the betting strategy itself. If the bookies play-ball and provide odds, I’ll place some bets and summarise how this experiment turned out!\nI’m also hoping this series will serve as an example of my analytical workflow: to that end I’ll explain some of the errors and simplifications I made along the way, how I spotted and resolved them.\n\nThere are likely modelling errors I haven’t noticed yet, comments are welcome!\nNot least I’ll say up front this work might not yield usable odds! Like many predictive models, this one is susceptible to Covid 19 impacts: putting aside the model itself, most of the track cycling calendar for 2020 and 2021 was cancelled, or attended by few athletes, so we simply don’t have much recent data to feed it.\nBut I won’t let that spoil the fun, after all you can’t win if you don’t play the game…\nAssumptions\nThis post makes some assumptions about you: that you have some prior exposure to regression, and evaluation metrics for classification models.\nI’ll assume you’re familiar with logistic regression and evaluating predictive performance with the log-loss - which I’ll tweak for the specifics of the competition format.\nIf you’re interested in reading underlying code, you’ll likely need some experience (or be keen to learn) a mix of R and Stan.\nTrack Sprinting and Data Overview\nA rule of thumb in modelling the outcome of sports matches is that rather than predicting binary win/lose probabilities, its better to predict expected score (or time) differences and infer the winner from this.\nAs Andrew Gelman puts it (in the context of election modelling): there’s a lot of information in the score (or vote) differential that’s thrown away if you just look at win/loss.\nThe Individual Sprint discipline in track cycling is interesting from a modelling perspective, as it forces us to diverge from this wisdom.\nThe sprint is contested by two athletes with the winner being the first across the line. Unlike its track and field equivalent, the sprint isn’t contested from the start: the race starts slowly with a tactical game of cat-and-mouse, before one rider tries to catch the other unaware and starts their sprint. This dynamic renders race times meaningless for prediction.\n\nA great example is the London 2012 women’s sprint final between Victoria Pendleton and Anna Meares.\nAbout the Data\nDetailed match results for most large track cycling events are maintained by Tissot. These results are made available in a common PDF format, that I have parsed to extract structured data from.\n\nThis work is available separately on GitHub\n\n\n\nThe data I’m using spans ~4 years from November 2017 to July 2021, and for this post I’ll focus on the women’s competition. During that period I have data for a total of 595 matches between 120 athletes.\nThe sample below shows the fields that are immediately relevant to the initial model I’ll fit in this post; I’ll explore other information I could extract from the result PDFs in later model fits.\n\n\nField\n\n\nExample\n\n\nevent\n\n\n2020 UCI TRACK WORLD CYCLING CHAMPIONSHIPS\n\n\ndate\n\n\n2020-02-28\n\n\ngender\n\n\nWomen\n\n\nround\n\n\nFinals\n\n\nrider_1\n\n\nHINZE EMMA\n\n\nrider_2\n\n\nVOINOVA ANASTASIIA\n\n\nrider_id_1\n\n\n41\n\n\nrider_id_2\n\n\n113\n\n\nwinner_id\n\n\n41\n\n\nloser_id\n\n\n113\n\n\n\nThe rider ID fields are derived, and are used for numeric indexing in the models\nIn all model runs I’ll use data up to the end of 2019 for training, and then evaluate against data from 2020 onward: a total of 522 matches in the training data, and 73 held out for evaluation.\nThe Bradley-Terry Model\nThe Bradley-Terry model is a well studied approach to paired comparisons, and particularly to win/lose matches, which originates in work by Zermelo, who used it to compare chess players abilities.\n\nThe model is the theoretical underpinning of the Elo Rating system used in chess ladders.\nThe model was re-discovered and popularised by Bradley and Terry in the 1950s - their example application is somewhat more esoteric, as they used it to rank pork roasts!\nI’ll introduce the model in the context of athletes competing in the Individual Sprint. Each of \\(R\\) athletes involved in the league are assumed to have some strength \\(\\beta_r\\), \\(r = 1,\\ldots, R\\), that describes their ability.\nThe Bradley-Terry model assumes that a rider \\(r\\) beats \\(s\\) with probability\n\\[\\mathbf P \\left[ r \\text{ beats } s\\right] = \\frac{\\beta_r}{\\beta_r + \\beta_s}.\\]\nThe aim is to estimate the strength parameters from historical matches, and then use these to predict future games.\nOne useful step is to change the scale of the strength parameters, considering \\(\\alpha = \\log \\beta\\), which changes the model to\n\\[ \n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf P \\left[ r \\text{ beats } s\\right] & = \\frac{e^{\\alpha_r}}{e^{\\alpha_r} + e^{\\alpha_s}} \\\\\n& = \\frac{e^{\\alpha_r - \\alpha_s}}{1 + e^{\\alpha_r - \\alpha_s}} \\\\\n& = \\text{logit}^{-1}\\big(\\alpha_r - \\alpha_s\\big)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThis transformation has converted a complex fractional relationship between rider strengths into a linear relationship, inside a link function.\nSpecifically, this model is now equivalent to a classic logistic regression problem. To see this more clearly we can look at how we might implement this in code:\nWe create a data frame with a row per match, and \\(R + 1\\) columns: one for each athlete, and one with the match outcome. The match between \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) then has 0 entries in each of the rider columns except for an entry of +1 in the column for \\(r\\), and -1 for \\(s\\). Finally the result column is set to 1 if the rider marked as +1 wins, and 0 if -1 wins.\n\nEx. \\(\\left(0,0,0,1,0,-1,0 ,\\, \\underline{1}\\right)\\) would denote a match between riders 4 and 6, in a league of 7, in which rider 4 won.\nThis could now be passed to your favourite tool for logistic regression (eg. glm in R) and you would fit the Bradley-Terry model above. Under the hood that will run an optimisation algorithm to find the vector of strengths \\(\\alpha^*\\) that maximises the likelihood.\nThere is a challenge however, as this solution won’t be unique: any translation by a constant \\(\\alpha^* + \\text{constant}\\) will have the same likelihood. In the frequentist approach this is resolved by introducing a constraint that \\(\\sum_r \\alpha_r = 0\\).\nThis CrossValidated post has good answers explaining how to achieve this with R’s glm function.\nThe Bayesian Bradley-Terry Model\nRather than following the frequentist approach, I’ll fit a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model. My general rationale for working with Bayesian models is here, but in this instance there’s an added incentive as it opens an alternative method to resolving the identifiability issue above.\nThe idea is that rather than forcing the coefficients to sum to 0, we can use priors on the rider strengths that helps the likelihood to focus on one specific translation over all others. In our case we’ll assume athlete strengths are normally distributed, with mean \\(0\\), which will lean the model towards configurations with \\(\\sum_r \\alpha_r = 0\\), without the need to code up this constraint explicitly.\n\nThis is referred to as soft centering in the Stan guidance, and is explained alongside other constraint methods here\nRather than specifying the standard deviation for the prior I will treat this as an unknown hyperparameter, \\(\\sigma\\). This is known as partial pooling, or hierarchical effects, and has the effect of ensuring the athlete strengths are on a common scale.\nThe prior for \\(\\sigma\\) needs to be constrained to be positive (since standard deviation is positive), and for now I’ll pick a common default of a half-normal distribution, with variance of 1. Putting this together we have the following model specification:\n\n\nBT1 \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\bf{\\text{Priors}}\\\\\n\\sigma & \\sim \\text{Half-Normal}(0,1) \\\\\n\\alpha_r & \\sim \\text{Normal}(0,\\sigma) \\\\\n\\\\\n\\bf{\\text{Likelihood}}\\\\\n\\alpha_r - \\alpha_s | W_{r,s} &\\sim \\text{logit}^{-1}(\\alpha_r - \\alpha_s)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\nExample Data\n\nShow code\nmatches_sample <-  matches %>%\n  filter(event == '2020 UCI TRACK WORLD CYCLING CHAMPIONSHIPS', round == 'Finals', gender == 'Women') %>%\n  mutate(across(everything(), as.character)) %>%\n  select(event, date, gender, round, rider_1,rider_2,rider_id_1,rider_id_2, winner_id,loser_id) %>%\n  slice(1)\n\nmatches_sample <- tibble(Field = names(matches_sample), Example = unlist(matches_sample[1,]))\nmatches_sample %>%\n  kable(\"pipe\") %>%\n  kable_styling(full_width=FALSE, bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"),font_size = 10)\n\n\nField\nExample\nevent\n2020 UCI TRACK WORLD CYCLING CHAMPIONSHIPS\ndate\n2020-02-28\ngender\nWomen\nround\nFinals\nrider_1\nHINZE EMMA\nrider_2\nVOINOVA ANASTASIIA\nrider_id_1\n41\nrider_id_2\n113\nwinner_id\n41\nloser_id\n113\n\n\n\nStan code\n\n\nwriteLines(readLines(paste0(remote_project_path, 'stan/bt1.stan')))\n\n\n\nfunctions {\n  real accuracy(vector delta, int start, int end){\n      vector[end - start + 1] delta_seg = segment(delta, start, end - start + 1);\n      real acc = 0;\n      \n      for(n in 1:num_elements(delta_seg)) acc += (delta_seg[n] > 0);\n\n      return inv(num_elements(delta_seg)) * acc;\n  }\n  \n  real log_loss(vector delta, int start, int end){\n      vector[end - start + 1] delta_seg = segment(delta, start, end - start + 1); \n      real ll = 0;\n      \n      return inv(num_elements(delta_seg)) * bernoulli_logit_lpmf(1 | delta_seg);\n  }\n}\n\ndata {\n  // Dimensions\n  int<lower=0> R; // Riders\n  int<lower=0> M; // Matches\n  int<lower=0,upper = M> T; // Training matches\n  \n  // Index for where train/test and round splits start \n  int<lower=1,upper=M> split_round_index[11];\n\n  // Match results\n  int<lower=1,upper=R> winner_id[M]; // ID's specifying riders in match\n  int<lower=1,upper=R> loser_id[M];\n}\n\nparameters {\n  // rider ratings\n  real<lower=0> sigma;\n  vector[R] alpha0;\n}\n\ntransformed parameters {\n  // difference of winner and loser rating\n  vector[M] delta =alpha0[winner_id] - alpha0[loser_id];\n}\n\nmodel {\n  // (hierarchical) priors - strength\n  sigma ~ normal(0,1);\n  alpha0 ~ normal(0,sigma);\n  \n  // likelihood\n  1 ~ bernoulli_logit(head(delta, T));\n}\n\ngenerated quantities {\n  // maximum theoretical strength difference between two riders\n  real<lower=0> delta_max = max(alpha0) - min(alpha0);\n  \n  // Calculate log-loss, match log-loss and accuracy.

Basic Bradley-Terry model.\nThroughout this series I’ll fit the models using Stan. The code for the model is available in the tab above. In these posts I’ll focus less on the implementation, and more on the outputs of the models.\n\nThe full model code, including the R pipeline to handle multiple models, is here.\nThe plot below shows the posterior 90% credible intervals for each rider’s strength, for clarity I’ve filtered the data down to those riders who have competed since the start of 2020.\n\nShow code\nriders <- read_remote_target(\"riders\")\n\nbt1_summ <- read_remote_target(\"bt_summary_bt1\")\n\nbt1_strength_summ <- bt1_summ %>%\n  filter(str_detect(variable, 'alpha')) %>%\n  mutate(rider_id = str_match(variable, '\\\\[(.*)\\\\]')[,2] %>% as.numeric()) %>%\n  left_join(riders) %>%\n  mutate(rider_name = fct_reorder(rider_name,median)) %>%\n  filter(max_date >= ymd(20200101))\n\np_strengths_bt1 <- ggplot(bt1_strength_summ) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x=q5,xend=q95,y=rider_name,yend=rider_name), color = infreq_palette[\"darkblue\"]) +\n  labs(y=\"\",x=\"Strength, α\")\n\np_strengths_bt1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a first pass the strengths seem to fit what we might expect: for instance the top four riders have all appeared in the Finals of the World Championships in either 2019 or 2020.\nWe can also see riders, such as Nicole Rodriguez, who appear in the evaluation date but not the training data: they have wider uncertainty intervals as the model can only assume they are average in absence of any data.\nThe next question is whether the scale of the strengths looks right. A good test scenario for this is to compare the weakest and strongest riders: suppose those two riders were to compete, what odds would we put on the weaker rider winning?\nThe table below summarises the posterior odds for that extremal match\n\nShow code\nbt1_max_odds <- bt1_summ %>%\n  filter(str_detect(variable, 'delta_max')) %>%\n  select( q5, median, q95) %>%\n  mutate(\n    # calculation is based on the fact that the strength difference is the log odds\n    # on the exponential scale\n    across(everything(), ~format(round(10^(./log(10)),-2),big.mark = \",\"))\n  )\n\nbt1_max_odds %>%\n  kable(col.names = c( \"5%\", \"50%\", \"95%\"), digits = 2) %>%\n  kable_styling(full_width=FALSE)\n\n\n\n5%\n\n\n50%\n\n\n95%\n\n\n1,200\n\n\n10,700\n\n\n165,700\n\n\n\nFigures should be read as 1 in …\nThe model is incredibly sceptical that the weakest rider could beat the strongest: I certainly can’t imagine a bookmaker offering odds on these scales!\nDoes the data genuinely support such high odds, or is this behaviour being encouraged by the somewhat arbitrary choice of prior distribution?\nPrior Predictive Checks\nPrior predictive checks provide results from the model in absence of any data: i.e. using only our prior assumptions. They provide a good test for whether the model is sensibly defined, and in particular whether the prior distributions you’re using are suitable.\nThe plot below shows the prior distribution for the odds that the weakest rider beats the strongest.\n\nA similar example of side effects of default priors on large parameter spaces is given in Gelman et al.’s Bayesian workflows paper, Fig. 3.\n\nShow code\nsigma_draws_halfnormal <- \n  tibble(draw = 1:10000, hyperprior = 'HalfNormal(0,1)') %>% mutate(sigma = abs(rnorm(n())))\n\nprior_draws_halfnormal <- crossing(rider = 1:nrow(riders), sigma_draws_halfnormal) %>%\n  mutate(alpha = rnorm(n(), sd = sigma))\n\nmax_diff_halfnormal <- prior_draws_halfnormal %>%\n  group_by(draw,hyperprior) %>%\n  summarise(\n    alpha_max = max(alpha),\n    alpha_min = min(alpha),\n    max_diff = alpha_max - alpha_min,\n    odds_weaker_wins_log10 = max_diff / log(10)\n  ) %>%\n  ungroup()\n \nggplot(max_diff_halfnormal, aes(odds_weaker_wins_log10)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = infreq_palette[\"beige\"]) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,8,by = 2), labels = scales::math_format(10^.x)) +\n  labs(x = 'Odds Weakest Beats Strongest', y = '')  +\n  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), axis.text.y=element_blank(), axis.line.y = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nThe prior spans several orders of magnitude: putting mass on odds from 1-1, up to 1-1,000,000.\nIn hindsight this feels too vague, and the long tail might be promoting the model to tend towards extreme scenarios.\nAn Informative Hyperprior\nMy personal instinct is that the odds should be more in the range of 1-100 up to 1-1,000, so as a first model development I’ll introduce a more informative prior to reflect my personal intuition about the scale of the odds.\nSince the model is defined in terms of strengths I’ll need to convert that range of 1-100 to 1-1,000 odds to a range for the difference in strengths. In practice this conversion is almost immediate as the strength differences are none-other than the (base-\\(e\\)) logarithm of the odds. That’s just the magic of logistic regression!\nSo my preferred odds range of between 1-100 and 1-1,000 translates to a maximum difference in athlete’s strength of between 4.6 and 6.9.\n\nEg. \\(1-10^k\\) odds are equivalent to a strength difference of \\(k/\\log_{10}(e^1) \\sim 0.43k\\).\nI’ve decided to work with a Gamma distribution for the hyperprior, and settled on shape and rate parameters of 80, and 60 respectively: these were chosen by trial and error, to create a prior distribution that nicely spanned the strength range above.\n\n\nσ - Hyperprior\n\nShow code\nsigma_draws_gamma <- tibble(draw = 1:10000, hyperprior = 'Gamma(80,60)') %>% mutate(sigma = rgamma(n(), 80, 60))\n\nsigma_draws <- bind_rows(sigma_draws_gamma, sigma_draws_halfnormal)\n\nggplot(sigma_draws, aes(sigma,fill=hyperprior)) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),binwidth = 0.05, color = infreq_palette[\"beige\"]) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,3)) +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(hyperprior)) +\n  labs(x = 'σ', y = '') + \n  theme(\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), axis.text.y=element_blank(), axis.line.y = element_blank(),\n          strip.background = element_blank(), strip.text = element_blank(), legend.title = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior on Maximum Strength Difference\n\nShow code\nprior_draws_gamma <- crossing(rider = 1:nrow(riders), sigma_draws_gamma) %>%\n  mutate(alpha = rnorm(n(), sd = sigma))\n\nmax_diff_gamma <- prior_draws_gamma %>%\n  group_by(draw,hyperprior) %>%\n  summarise(\n    alpha_max = max(alpha),\n    alpha_min = min(alpha),\n    max_diff = alpha_max - alpha_min,\n    odds_weaker_wins_log10 = max_diff / log(10)\n  )\n\nmax_diff <- bind_rows(max_diff_gamma, max_diff_halfnormal)\n\n\nggplot(max_diff, aes(max_diff,fill=hyperprior)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),binwidth = 0.25, color = infreq_palette[\"beige\"]) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,15)) +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(hyperprior)) +\n  # scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,8,by = 2), labels = paste0(\"10^\",seq(0,8,by = 2) )) +\n  labs(x = 'Max.

Basic Bradley-Terry model, with Gamma hyperprior.\nVisually the plot of posterior strengths looks pretty similar under the revised model to the original, so I’ll skip presenting it.\nHowever, the change in prior does have a material impact on the maximum odds statistic, this is summarised in the table below which shows both the prior and posterior ranges for this statistic, for the two models.\n\nShow code\nbt2_summ <- read_remote_target(\"bt_summary_bt2\")\n\nbt2_max_odds <- bt2_summ %>%\n  filter(str_detect(variable, 'delta_max')) %>%\n  select(q5, median, q95) %>%\n  mutate(\n    # calculation is based on the fact that the strength difference is the log odds\n    # on the exponential scale\n    across(everything(), ~format(round(10^(./log(10)),-2),big.mark = \",\"))\n  )\n\nprior_max_odds <- max_diff %>%\n  mutate(model = if_else(hyperprior == 'Gamma(80,60)', 'bt2 - Prior', 'bt1 - Prior')) %>%\n  group_by(model) %>%\n  summarise(\n    q5 = quantile(10^odds_weaker_wins_log10, 0.05) %>% round(-1) %>% format(big.mark = \",\"),\n    median = quantile(10^odds_weaker_wins_log10,0.5) %>% round(-1) %>% format(big.mark = \",\"),\n    q95 = quantile(10^odds_weaker_wins_log10, 0.95) %>% round(-1) %>% format(big.mark = \",\")\n  )\n\nbind_rows(\n  bt1_max_odds %>% add_column(model = 'bt1 - Posterior', .before = 0),\n  bt2_max_odds %>% add_column(model = 'bt2 - Posterior', .before = 0),\n  prior_max_odds\n)  %>%\nmutate(\n  model = factor(model, levels = c(\"bt1 - Prior\", \"bt1 - Posterior\", \"bt2 - Prior\", \"bt2 - Posterior\"))\n)%>%\n  arrange(model) %>%\n  kable(col.names = c(\"\", \"5%\", \"50%\", \"95%\"), digits = 2) %>%\n  kable_styling(full_width=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n5%\n\n\n50%\n\n\n95%\n\n\nbt1 - Prior\n\n\n0\n\n\n30\n\n\n31,910\n\n\nbt1 - Posterior\n\n\n1,200\n\n\n10,700\n\n\n165,700\n\n\nbt2 - Prior\n\n\n180\n\n\n870\n\n\n6,810\n\n\nbt2 - Posterior\n\n\n800\n\n\n3,600\n\n\n22,900\n\n\n\nFigures should be read as 1 in …\nIn both cases we can see that the posterior distributions are quite different from the priors. In the case of BT2 we can see that the extreme behaviour allowed by the naive prior choice has been reined in (even then its still much higher than my prior thought).\nEvaluation Metrics\nWith two models to hand, its time to consider how we can choose between the two; I’ll consider two formal evaluation metircs. Model accuracy answers the simple question If you always bet on the stronger athlete, how often would you win?. The log loss gives a more nuanced measure: penalising predictions when the model put a very low probability on the actual observed outcome.\n\nMy accuracy measure implicitly assumes a cutoff of 0.5; using a different cut-off is important when there is class imbalance, but our data is naturally balanced as every match has 1 winner and 1 loser.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Accuracy} & = \\text{Prop. of matches where the modelled stronger rider wins.} \\\\\n\\text{Log Loss} & = \\text{Average log-probability assigned to the observed outcome.} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe definition of the log loss is equivalent to the log likelihood of the data, but divided by the number of data points so that we can more readily compare training/test performance.\n\nLog loss is normally multiplied by -1 to be positive: I avoid this convention as this way better models will\nAs a benchmark for model performance we can compare to the model in which we randomly guess the winner. On average this algorithm would have an accuracy of \\(\\frac12\\) (as we’d expect half of its guesses to be correct), and the log loss is fixed at \\(\\log(\\frac12) \\approx -0.693\\).\nModels with better predictive power will have higher accuracy (closer to 1), and higher log loss (closer to 0).\n\n\nAccuracy\n\nShow code\nbt1_measures <- bt1_summ %>%\n  filter(str_detect(variable,'(accuracy|log_loss)\\\\[6\\\\]')) %>%\n  extract(variable, into = c(\"split\", \"measure\"), \"(.*?)_(.*)\\\\[6\\\\]\") %>%\n  mutate(\n    model = 'bt1',\n    model_split = paste(model, \"-\", split)\n  )\n\nbt2_measures <- bt2_summ %>%\n  filter(str_detect(variable,'(accuracy|log_loss)\\\\[6\\\\]')) %>%\n  extract(variable, into = c(\"split\", \"measure\"), \"(.*?)_(.*)\\\\[6\\\\]\") %>%\n  mutate(\n    model = 'bt2',\n    model_split = paste(model, \"-\", split)\n  )\n\nmeasures <- bind_rows(bt1_measures, bt2_measures)\n\n\n\n\nModel\nSplit\n5%\n50% (Median)\n95%\nbt1\nevaluation\n0.644\n0.712\n0.781\nbt2\nevaluation\n0.644\n0.712\n0.781\nbt1\ntraining\n0.768\n0.791\n0.810\nbt2\ntraining\n0.764\n0.787\n0.807\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog Loss\n\nShow code\nlog_loss <- measures %>%\n  filter(measure == \"log_loss\")\n\nlog_loss %>% \n  select(model, split,  q5, median, q95) %>%\n  arrange(split, model) %>%\n  kable(\"pipe\", col.names =c(\"Model\", \"Split\", \"5%\", \"50% (Median)\", \"95%\"), digits =3)\n\n\nModel\nSplit\n5%\n50% (Median)\n95%\nbt1\nevaluation\n-0.811\n-0.649\n-0.536\nbt2\nevaluation\n-0.757\n-0.631\n-0.534\nbt1\ntraining\n-0.468\n-0.441\n-0.418\nbt2\ntraining\n-0.474\n-0.450\n-0.428\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth models have accuracies that are well above the benchmark, indicating that using either model is better than random guessing, though there’s little distinction between the two models. This is to be expected as the accuracy will only change if the two models differ in their opinion about who the stronger rider is in each match, and we wouldn’t expect that to happen in many cases.\nThe log loss is more interesting: on the training data the log loss is better than guessing, but this isn’t the case in the evaluation data. Amongst the evaluation data, there’s some weak evidence that the Gamma prior (bt2) fairs marginally better.\nThis poor performance in log loss is driven by upsets: where the model is highly confident in one athlete winning, and then they don’t. For instance suppose a model thinks that a given athlete will win with probability 0.999, if they then fail to win that contributes a factor of \\(\\log(1 - 0.999) \\approx -6.908\\) to the log loss, as opposed to if they win in which case the contribution is \\(-0.001\\).\nThe Gamma prior fairs better as it was designed to lead the model away from scenarios where it offers astronomical odds.\nNext Steps\nIn this post I’ve introduced the basic Bradley-Terry model, and shown that it out performs a strategy of random guessing.\nIn the next post I’ll start to deviate from the standard model, accounting for features available in the data that should help to improve the predictive power of the model.\nComments\nAcknowledgments\nPrevious implementations of Bradley-Terry models using Stan have been posted by Bob Carpenter and opisthokonta.net (Jonas).\nThis post makes heavy use of R and Stan, and so benefits from the many people who contribute to their development.\n\n\n\n",

I’ll take up his challenge and derive an explicit formula for the likelihood function, enabling a Bayesian analysis without the need for sampling methods.\nI’ll also propose an alternative model to take into account my personal belief that the Tweet was sent in the knowledge that the twelfth sock was going to break the run of distinct socks!\nAssumptions\nThis post makes some assumptions about you: that you have some experience with (or a willingness to learn) statistics and discrete probability.\nI’ll assume that you’re familiar twith the concepts of Bayesian statistics: a model (the likelihood) describes our understanding of how some data is generated, it can be combined with initial assumptions about plausible parameter values (prior distributions) and combining these with observed data leads to refined assumptions (posterior distributions).\nTo follow the derivation of the likelihood you’ll need to know some common constructs from discrete probability/combinatorics: e.g. understanding of binomial coefficients, and how these relate to counting problems.\nBååth’s Model\nOur aim is to estimate the total number of socks that Karl Broman washed given his Tweet that the first 11 removed from the washing machine were distinct.\nI’ll use the following notation throughout:\n\nI use the convention that data is denoted by letters from the Roman alphabet, whilst unknown parameters use the Greek alphabet.\n\\[\n\\begin{align*} \\bf{\\text{Data}}\\\\\nd & = \\text{No. successive distinct socks observed before Tweeting}\\\\\n\\\\\n\\bf{\\text{Parameters}}\\\\\n\\rho & = \\text{No. pairs of socks in the wash}\\\\\n\\sigma & = \\text{No. singleton socks in the wash} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nIn the case of the Tweet, \\(d = 11\\). Using two parameters \\(\\rho\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) allows us to handle the scenario that whilst most socks come in pairs, in some households stray singleton socks are not uncommon. I will however assume socks don’t come in multiples of more than two, rulling out the not-uncommon scenario in which two pairs of identical socks are washed.\nThe likelihood, \\(L(d|\\rho,\\sigma)\\), describes how the unknown parameters generate the obsered data: Assuming there were \\(\\rho\\) pairs of socks and \\(\\sigma\\) singletons how likely is it that the first \\(d\\) socks are all distinct?\nAs a warm up for deriving a complete formula, I’ll consider some of the edge cases which have logical heuristics:\nScenario\nHeuristic\nLikelihood \\(L(d|\\rho,\\sigma)\\)\n\\(\\rho, \\, \\sigma < 0\\)\nLet’s not be silly: you can’t have negative socks.\n0\n\\(d > 2\\rho + \\sigma\\)\nWe can’t observe more socks than were washed.\n0\n\\(d > \\rho + \\sigma\\)\nWe can’t observe more distinct socks than the number of distinct socks that were washed.\n0\n\\(\\rho = 0, \\, \\sigma \\geq d\\)\nIf all the socks were different, then of course all the observed socks are different.\n1\nWith the edge cases handled, I’ll press on and handle the substantive problem.\n\n\nLikelihood \\[\nL(\\rho,\\sigma|d) = \n\\binom{2\\rho + \\sigma}{d}^{-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\sigma} 2^{d-j} \\binom{\\sigma}{j} \\binom{\\rho}{d-j}\n\\]\n\n\nExamples \\[\nL(\\rho,\\sigma|d) = \n\\binom{2\\rho + \\sigma}{d}^{-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\sigma} 2^{d-j} \\binom{\\sigma}{j} \\binom{\\rho}{d-j}\n\\]\nAs a soft check that the formula above is correct, let’s take a look at some specific cases.\nExample: \\(\\bf{\\rho = 1, \\, \\sigma = 1, \\,d = 2}\\).\nThis is the smallest non-trivial scenario, and we can check this easily by hand. Denoting the socks by {S,P1,P2}, there are three ways to choose two of them: {S,P1}, {S,P2} and {P1,P2}. In two of the scenarios the socks are distinct, so the likelihood is 2/3.\nPlugging the parameters/data into the formula above: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nL(2,1|2) & =   \\binom{3}{2}^{-1} \\left\\{ 2^2 \\binom{1}{0}\\binom{1}{2} + 2^1 \\binom{1}{1}\\binom{1}{1}\\right\\} = 3^{-1}\\left(0 + 2\\right)  = \\frac23\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nExample: \\(\\bf{\\rho=3,\\,\\sigma=4, \\, d = 4}\\)\nWhilst this example doesn’t sound much more complex, crunching numbers directly would be pretty tedious (admittedly, tricky) as the denominator of the likelihood formula suggests there are 210 scenarios to check.\nEvaluating the formula for these parameters indicates the likelihood is 129/210 ~ 0.614.\nTo validate this claim, I’ll simulate drawing 4 socks from 3 pairs and 4 singletons, and calculate the proportion of these simulations that return distinct socks.\n\nShow code\nset.seed(1414214)\n\nrho <- 3\nsigma <- 4\nd <- 4\n\n# vector of all the socks\nall_socks <- c(rep(paste0(\"P\",1:rho), 2), paste0(\"S\", 1:sigma))\n\n# a function to sample d socks without replacement from all_socks, and return\n# 1 if all socks are distinct, and 0 otherwise\nsample_socks <- function(all_socks, d){\n  sock_sample <- sample(x = all_socks, size = d, replace = FALSE)\n  return( 1 * (length(sock_sample) == length(unique(sock_sample))) )\n}\n\n# draw samples \ndraws <- tibble(draw = map_dbl(1:1e05, ~sample_socks(all_socks, d)))\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nNo. Draws\n100,000\nNo. All Distinct\n61,360\nProb. All Distinct\n0.614\n\n\n\nProof\n\\[\nL(\\rho,\\sigma|d) = \n\\binom{2\\rho + \\sigma}{d}^{-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\sigma} 2^{d-j} \\binom{\\sigma}{j} \\binom{\\rho}{d-j}\n\\]\nProof\nIn words, the likelihood is given by the following fraction\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{No. ways to choose d }{\\bf{distinct}}\\text{ socks from $\\rho$ pairs and $\\sigma$ singletons.}}{\\text{No. ways to choose d socks from  $\\rho$ pairs and $\\sigma$ singletons.}} \n\\]\nStarting with the denominator, this is none other than the total number of ways to choose \\(d\\) objects without replacement from a total of \\(2 \\rho + \\sigma\\) (the factor of two is because \\(\\rho\\) pairs of socks equates to \\(2 \\rho\\) individual socks). That is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{2\\rho + \\sigma}{d}\\), and explains the leading term in the likelihood formula above.\nTurning to the numerator, I’ll break this down by conditioning on the number of singleton socks. counting:\n\\[\\text{No. of ways to choose $d$ distinct socks, given that $j$ of them are singletons.}\\]\nStarting with the sigletons, there are \\(\\binom{\\sigma}{j}\\) ways to choose exactly \\(j\\) of these. The remaining \\(d-j\\) socks need to come from the pairs, there are \\(\\rho\\) distinct socks that form \\(2\\rho\\) pairs, so there are \\(\\binom{\\rho}{d-j}\\) ways to choose the type of socks. But then for each of these \\(d-j\\) socks we need an additional factor of 2 as we could have chosen between two (left, and right) socks. Bringing this together, we have:\n\\[2^{d-j}\\binom{\\rho}{d-j}\\binom{\\sigma}{j}.\\]\nThe full formula for numerator, and then the likelihood, follows by summing over the possible values of \\(j = 0,\\ldots,\\sigma\\).\nFor a similar proof, I previously posted an answer to a question on Cross Validated with a slightly different sock related problem.\n\n\nIn practice when evaluating the likelihood (and later the posterior distribution) there are some computational tricks we employ to avoid running into problems of integer overflow; these are detailed in the end-notes.\nIn the plot below we visualise the likelihood for the case of interest, \\(d = 11\\).\n\nShow code\n# log likelihood for Baath's model\nbaath_log_likelihood <- function(rho, sigma, d){\n  \n  # it is not possible to choose more than p+s distinct socks\n  if(d > rho + sigma) return(-Inf)\n  \n  # log summation terms, for the log-sum-exp trick.\n  log_summation_terms <- purrr::map(0:min(d, sigma), function(j){\n    (d-j)*log(2) + lchoose(sigma,j) + lchoose(rho,d-j)\n  })\n  \n  log_likelihood <- -lchoose(2*rho + sigma,d) +  logSumExp(log_summation_terms)\n  \n  return(log_likelihood)\n}\n\n# compute grid of likelihood values, fix d = 11\n# calculate_sock_grid defined in the Utility Functions appendix\nbaath_likelihood_grid <- \n  calculate_sock_grid(\n    rho_max = 30, sigma_max = 20,\n    log_likelihood = function(rho,sigma){baath_log_likelihood(rho,sigma,d=11)}\n  )\n\n# plot likelihood grid\n# plot_sock_grid defined in the Utility Functions appendix\nplot_sock_grid(baath_likelihood_grid, var = likelihood)\n\n\n\n\n\nBååth’s Likelihood\nThe plot demonstrates why a frequentist, maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) approach to solving this problem is guaranteed to give unsatisfactory results: insisting that the most likely scenario is that all of the socks in the wash were unique, and being non-committal about how many there were in total (the likelihood is maximised simultaneously for all scenarios where \\(\\sigma \\geq 11\\), and \\(\\rho = 0\\)).\nEven introducing an assumption that there’s at least one pair is unsatisfactory: in this case the maximum is never achieved as the likelihood increases as \\(\\rho,\\sigma \\rightarrow \\infty\\).\nFrom Prior to Posterior\nTo avoid getting stuck in trivial edge scenarios, I’ll introduce a prior distribution over \\((\\rho,\\sigma)\\), and conduct a Bayesian Analysis. The prior captures our beliefs about the number of socks in the washing machine, in absence of any data.\nI’ll put separate priors on the number of singleton and pairs of socks, and then add a restriction that the total socks can’t exceed a fixed (large) amount. This differs from Rasmus’ approach, but produces formulae that are easier to work with: since Rasmus was using sampling, complexity in the formulae wasn’t an issue.\n\nIt is possible to derive a formula for Rasmus’ prior - but its messy! For the really invested, see the footnotes.\nCapping the maximum number of socks has a natural interpretation as we know there are limits on how many socks could fit in a domestic washing machine. More importantly the cap is essential for computing the normalising constant that crops up when using Bayes rule. To dig into that in more detail, I’ll denote \\(p(\\rho,\\sigma)\\) for the prior distribution, \\(p(\\rho, \\sigma) |d)\\) for the posterior distribution, and \\(L(d|\\rho,\\sigma)\\) the likelihdood as before, then Bayes rule gives\n\\[p(\\rho,\\sigma | d) = Z^{-1}L(d | \\rho, \\sigma) p(\\rho,\\sigma), \\qquad \\text{where } Z = \\sum_{\\rho,\\sigma} L(d | \\rho, \\sigma) p(\\rho,\\sigma).\\]\nFor arbitrary choices of priors, we cannot expect to be able to derive a formula for \\(Z\\) directly - and thefore we need to evaluate it computationally. By restricting \\(\\rho, \\,\\sigma\\) to a finite range we can calculate \\(Z\\) without having to make estimates of the tail behaviour.\nThe prior distribution on \\(\\rho\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) should be a discrete distribution, on the positive integers. Like Rasmus I’ll use Negative Binomial distributions, which are a flexible generalisation of the Poisson distribution, allowing us to separately control the mean and variance.\n\n\n\nI’ll choose parameters for the Negative Binomial distributions so that the marginal distributions of the product prior closely match those of Rasmus’ prior, which he derived based on assumptions about the plausible amount of washing a family might produce. This leads to me using the priors:\n\nParameters were found using the Method of Moments and then rounded to give nice values\n\\[\\rho \\sim \\text{NegBinom}\\left(3 \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{5}\\right), \\qquad \\sigma \\sim \\text{NegBinom}\\left(2, \\frac{1}{3}\\right),\\]\nI’ll cap the maximum number of socks that could plausibly have been washed at 300; to justify this: Googling the average weight of a sock returns a range of estimates, but low estimates said a sock weighs 50g. 300 socks would therefore come in at 15kg, which is the maximum drum size of any domestic washing machine I could find on Amazon!\nWriting out the prior explicitly gives:\n\\[p(\\rho,\\sigma) = \\textstyle \\mathbf{\\large 1}_{2\\rho + \\sigma \\leq 300} \\, \\times \\, \\binom{\\rho + 2\\frac{1}{4}}{\\rho} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right)^{3 \\frac{1}{4}} \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^{\\rho} \\,\\,\\times\\,\\, \\binom{\\sigma + 1}{\\sigma} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\sigma}\\]\nThe plots/table below compare samples from the product prior and the prior Rasmus uses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarginals\n\n\n\n\nMeasure\nPrior\n10%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n90%\nTotal socks\nBååth\n13\n19\n28\n38\n50\n\nProduct\n12\n18\n27\n39\n52\nPairs of socks\nBååth\n5\n8\n12\n17\n22\n\nProduct\n4\n7\n12\n17\n24\nSingleton socks\nBååth\n1\n2\n3\n5\n8\n\nProduct\n0\n1\n3\n6\n9\nProportion single\nBååth\n0.03\n0.06\n0.1\n0.16\n0.22\n\nProduct\n0\n0.05\n0.12\n0.23\n0.37\n\n\n\nDensity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of Bååth’s Prior and the Product Prior.\nThe marginal distributions align closely, with the exception that the product prior has larger tails for the proportion of singleton socks. This is visible in the (empirical) density plot where Rasmus’ prior clearly has a sharper peak, and is less dispersed in the \\(\\sigma\\)-axis.\nThe density plot also shows that the product prior is smoother over the parameter space - this is to be expected as defining Rasmus’ prior requires a rounding/floor calculation (which is itself not smooth) to separate the total socks into pairs/singletons.\nFinally I will go ahead and derive the posterior using Bayes rule. The animation below shows how the posterior distribution changes with the observation of each additional distinct sock, up to \\(d=11\\).\n\nShow code\n# define the log product prior\nlog_product_prior <- function(rho, sigma, r_rho, p_rho, r_sigma, p_sigma, cap){\n\n  if(2*rho + sigma > cap){\n    log_prior <- -Inf\n  }\n  else{\n    log_prior <- dnbinom(rho, size = r_rho, prob = p_rho, log = TRUE) +\n      dnbinom(sigma, size = r_sigma, prob = p_sigma, log = TRUE)\n  }\n  \n  return(log_prior)\n}\n\n# calculate posterior grid for each of d = 0,...,11 for animation\niterated_posterior_grid <- map(0:11, .f =function(d){\n  \n  if(d == 0){\n    posterior_grid <- calculate_sock_grid(150, 300,\n        log_likelihood = NULL,\n        log_prior = function(rho,sigma){\n          log_product_prior(rho,sigma, r_rho, p_rho, r_sigma, p_sigma, cap = 300)\n          }\n      ) %>%\n      filter(2*rho+sigma <= 300) %>%\n      mutate(posterior =prior) %>%\n      add_column(d = d, .before = 0)\n  } else {\n    posterior_grid <- calculate_sock_grid(100, 100,\n        log_likelihood = function(rho,sigma){baath_log_likelihood(rho,sigma,d=d)},\n        log_prior = function(rho,sigma){\n          log_product_prior(rho,sigma, r_rho, p_rho, r_sigma, p_sigma, cap = 300)\n          }\n      ) %>%\n      filter(2*rho+sigma <= 300) %>%\n      add_column(d = d, .before = 0)\n  }\n  \n  return(posterior_grid)\n}) %>% bind_rows()\n\n# actual posterior grid\nposterior_grid <- iterated_posterior_grid %>% filter(d==11)\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Socks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior Grid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMode\n10%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n90%\nPrior\n22\n11\n17\n27\n38\n52\nBååth’s Posterior\n38\n27\n34\n44\n56\n69\n\nFor completeness I’ll replicate Rasmus’ ABC methodology (with his original prior), to comparethe posterior distributions:\n\n\nMode\n10%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n90%\nABC Posterior\n35\n29\n35\n43\n54\n65\n\nThe posterior mode (or Maximum a posteriori estimate, MAP) is the most likely number of socks under the posterior distribution, which we find to be 38 socks, with a 90% credible interval of [27, 69].\nFortunately for us there is no mystery to the true answer of the number of socks that were washed, which Karl Broman confirmed to be 45, which is consistent with the posterior estimates:\n\n@rabaath @sgrifter There were 21 pairs and 3 singletons. Will spend the rest of the evening working out what my est would have been.— Karl Broman (@kwbroman) October 17, 2014\n\n\nStopping Time Model\nRasmus’ model assumes that having drawn the eleventh sock, Karl Broman took to Twitter without checking whether or not the twelfth sock was also distinct.\nCall me a sceptic, but I can’t help but think that in fact the twelfth sock was observed, seen to break the run, and the Tweet was made in this knowledge. To finish off this post I’ll derive the likelihood takes into account this additional information, and see how this changes our posterior estimates.\n\nAnother limitation in both Rasmus and my model is publication bias; Thomas Lumley discusses this point in detail in this blog post.\nFor my model rather than working with the data \\(d\\), I’ll introduce\n\\[\n\\begin{align*} \\bf{\\text{Data}}\\\\\nf & = \\text{No. socks prior to the first duplicate}\n\\end{align*}\n\\] The parameters of the model will remain as before \\(\\rho, \\, \\sigma\\). To be clear, in this notation the first \\(f\\) socks are distinct, with sock \\(f+1\\) matching one of the socks already drawn. So in the case of the Tweet, \\(f = 11\\).\n\nWe call this a stopping time as the random variable is defined by a process that we continue until a particular rule is achieved, at which point we stop: in this the rule is stop when a duplicate sock is drawn.\n\n\nLikelihood \\[\nL(\\rho,\\sigma|f) = \n\\left\\{(2\\rho + \\sigma -f)\\binom{2\\rho + \\sigma}{f}\\right\\}^{-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\sigma} 2^{f-j} \\binom{\\sigma}{j} \\binom{\\rho}{f-j} \\left(f-j\\right)\n\\]\n\n\nExamples \\[\nL(\\rho,\\sigma|f) = \n\\left\\{(2\\rho + \\sigma -f)\\binom{2\\rho + \\sigma}{f}\\right\\}^{-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\sigma} 2^{f-j} \\binom{\\sigma}{j} \\binom{\\rho}{f-j} \\left(f-j\\right)\n\\]\nExample: \\(\\bf{\\rho=3,\\,\\sigma=4, \\, f = 4}\\)\nAs before I will check the formula by comparing it to an estimate derived by sampling.\n\n\n\nFor the parameter choices set out above, the likelihood formula evaluates to give 0.210.\n\nShow code\nset.seed(1414214)\n\nrho <- 3\nsigma <- 4\nf <- 4\n\n# vector of all the socks\nall_socks <- c(rep(paste0(\"P\",1:rho), 2), paste0(\"S\", 1:sigma))\n\n# a function to sample d socks without replacement from all_socks, and return\n# 1 if all socks are distinct, and 0 otherwise\nsample_socks <- function(all_socks, f){\n  # draw one more sock than f, as stopping time is checked at f+1\n  sock_sample <- sample(x = all_socks, size = f + 1, replace = FALSE)\n\n  # is f+1 the stopping time? i.e. the first non-distinct sock\n  stopping_time <-  1 *\n    # first f socks are distinct\n    (length(sock_sample[-1]) == length(unique(sock_sample[-1]))) *\n    # last sock is not distinct\n    (sock_sample[1] %in% sock_sample[-1])\n\n  return(stopping_time)\n}\n\n# draw samples \ndraws <- tibble(draw = map_dbl(1:1e05, ~sample_socks(all_socks, f)))\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nNo. Draws\n100,000\nNo. Stopping Time\n20,851\nProb.

In particular we’re looking to calculate\n\\[\\text{No. ways to choose $f$ distinct socks, followed by a duplicate,}\\\\ \\text{given that $j$ of the first $f$ are singletons.}\\]\nWe know from the previous proof that the number of ways to choose \\(f\\) distinct socks, with \\(j\\) singletons is\n\\[2^{f-j} \\binom{\\sigma}{j}\\binom{\\rho}{f-j},\\]\nto this we just need to multiply the number of ways that we can pick one further sock, that matches one of the first \\(f\\). Only \\(f-j\\) of the socks chosen so far have a pair (the others being singletons), so therefore there are \\(f-j\\) socks we could pick on the next draw that would be a duplicate. Putting this together gives the summation part of the liklihood.\nIt remains to derive the denominator: in our previous calculation this was the number of ways to pick unordered socks, and was given by a binomial coefficient. This time we want to pick \\(f\\) socks, for which the order does not matter, and then one additional sock that is singled out as the last sock. That last sock can be chosen from amongst the \\(2\\rho + \\sigma - f\\) remaining socks, from which we get the denominator:\n\\[\\binom{2\\rho + \\sigma}{f}(2\\rho + \\sigma - f).\\]\n\n\nRecall that Rasmus’ likelihood preferred configurations that either had only singleton socks, or infinitely many socks. This is not the case for the stopping time model: in particular the requirement that a duplicate is drawn rules out the scenario of all singleton socks, and in the limit \\(\\rho \\rightarrow \\infty\\) the probability of drawing a duplicate becomes negligible.\nThis later observation gives us some intuition that we can expect the posterior distribution under the stopping time distribution to be focused on configurations with fewer socks than Rasmus’ model. This is confirmed in the posterior summaries below.\n\nI’ve used the same product prior as in the previous section.\n\nShow code\n# log likelihood for Baath's model\nst_log_likelihood <- function(rho, sigma, f){\n  \n  # it is not possible to choose more than p+s distinct socks\n  if(f > rho + sigma) return(-Inf)\n  \n  # it is not possible to get a duplicate if all socks are distinct\n  if(rho == 0) return(-Inf)\n  \n  # its not possible to pick more socks than were washed\n  if(f+1 > 2*rho + sigma) return(-Inf)\n  \n  # log summation terms, for the log-sum-exp trick.\n  log_summation_terms <- purrr::map(0:min(f, sigma), function(j){\n    (f-j)*log(2) + lchoose(sigma,j) + lchoose(rho,f-j) + log(f-j)\n  })\n  \n  log_likelihood <- -lchoose(2*rho + sigma,f) - log(2*rho + sigma - f) +  logSumExp(log_summation_terms)\n  \n  return(log_likelihood)\n}\n\nst_posterior_grid <- calculate_sock_grid(100, 100,\n        log_likelihood = function(rho,sigma){st_log_likelihood(rho,sigma,f=11)},\n        log_prior = function(rho,sigma){log_product_prior(rho,sigma, r_rho, p_rho, r_sigma, p_sigma, cap = 300)}\n      ) %>%\n      filter(rho <= 150, sigma <= 300)\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Socks\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior Grid\n\n# A tibble: 10,201 x 8\n# Rowwise: \n     rho sigma log_likelihood log_prior log_posterior likelihood\n   <int> <int>          <dbl>     <dbl>         <dbl>      <dbl>\n 1     0     0           -Inf     -7.43          -Inf          0\n 2     0     1           -Inf     -7.14          -Inf          0\n 3     0     2           -Inf     -7.14          -Inf          0\n 4     0     3           -Inf     -7.26          -Inf          0\n 5     0     4           -Inf     -7.44          -Inf          0\n 6     0     5           -Inf     -7.66          -Inf          0\n 7     0     6           -Inf     -7.91          -Inf          0\n 8     0     7           -Inf     -8.19          -Inf          0\n 9     0     8           -Inf     -8.47          -Inf          0\n10     0     9           -Inf     -8.77          -Inf          0\n# … with 10,191 more rows, and 2 more variables: prior <dbl>,\n#   posterior <dbl>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMode\n10%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n90%\nPrior\n22\n11\n17\n27\n38\n52\nBååth’s Posterior\n38\n27\n34\n44\n56\n69\nStopping Time Posterior\n34\n24\n30\n38\n49\n61\n\nAlthough the posterior mode is lower for the stopping time model, the true answer of 45 socks is still comfortably within the central 50% credible interval.\nComments\nAcknowledgments\nThis post was inspired by Karl Broman’s tweet, and Rasmus Bååth’s analysis.\nComputation has been done using R.\nComputational Considerations\nIn practice we use a couple of tricks when computing the likelihood function: avoiding the risk of encountering integer overflow when working with large sums of binomial coefficients.\nThe first trick is probably familiar: rather than working with the likelihood, we’ll use the log-likelihood. The log-likelihood for Bååth’s model is:\n\\[l(d|\\rho,\\sigma) = -\\log \\textstyle{\\binom{2\\rho + \\sigma}{d}} + \\log \\bigg(\\textstyle \\sum_{j=0}^{\\sigma} 2^{d-j} \\binom{\\sigma}{j} \\binom{\\rho}{d-j}\\bigg)\\]\nIf we naively go ahead and calculate that sum and then take logs - then we won’t avoid the risk of overflow at all: we’d still calculate a sum of large integers, and taking the logarithm becomes an after thought.\nWhat we really want to do is take the logarithm of the terms inside the summation - which will return values well within computational comfort zone. That is we want to turn a computation of the form \\(\\log \\left( x_1 + \\cdots + x_n\\right)\\) into a calculation in \\(\\log(x_1),\\ldots, \\log(x_n)\\).\nThis is where trick number two comes in: the log-sum-exp trick.\n\n\nLog-Sum-Exp Trick Given \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n > 0\\), let \\(l_k = \\log(x_k)\\) and \\(l^* = \\max_k l_k\\). Then\n\\[\n\\log(x_1 + \\cdots +  x_n) =  l^* + \\log \\bigg ( \\exp(l_1 - l^*) + \\cdots + \\exp(l_n - l^*)\\bigg)\n\\]\n\n\nExample Given \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n > 0\\), let \\(l_k = \\log(x_k)\\) and \\(l^* = \\max_k l_k\\). Then\n\\[\n\\log(x_1 + \\cdots +  x_n) =  l^* + \\log \\bigg ( \\exp(l_1 - l^*) + \\cdots + \\exp(l_n - l^*)\\bigg)\n\\]\nExample: \\(\\bf{\\rho = 30, \\, \\sigma = 2, \\,d = 11}\\).\nThis particular set of parameters admits a relatively concise likelihood, which will help us to write the complete formulae, starting with the log-likelihood:\n\\[\nl(11 | 2,30) = -\\log \\textstyle  \\binom{62}{11} + \\log \\bigg(2^{11} \\binom{2}{0}\\binom{30}{11} + 2^{10} \\binom{2}{1}\\binom{30}{10} + 2^{9} \\binom{2}{2}\\binom{30}{9} \\bigg).\n\\]\nIf we do this by brute force, using R to evaluate each of the powers, and binomial coefficients this becomes:\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n l(11|2,30) & = -\\log 508271323092 \\\\\n & \\qquad + \\log \\big ( \n  111876710400 + 61532190720 + 7325260800\n \\big) \\\\\n & = - 26.95 + 25.92 \\\\\n & = -1.034\n\\end{align}\\]\nAnd back on the natural scale, that implies a likelihood of \\(L(11 |2,30) \\approx 0.36\\).\nThe bit that feels uncomfortable there is the sum of all those +10 digit numbers - and in real cases we could be summing more terms - each with more digits. So now let’s see how that looks using the log-sum-exp trick.\nAs per the statement above, we’ll first calculate the log of each of the terms (and include the denominator term, denoted \\(A\\) here, which we’ll need for the full calculation):\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\textstyle \\log \\binom{62}{11} & = A  \\approx 26.9543 \\\\\n\\textstyle \\log 2^{11} \\binom{2}{0}\\binom{30}{11} &= l_1 \\approx 25.4407 \\\\\n\\textstyle \\log  2^{10} \\binom{2}{1}\\binom{30}{10} &= l_2 \\approx 24.8428 \\\\\n\\textstyle \\log 2^{9} \\binom{2}{2}\\binom{30}{9} &= l_3 \\approx 22.7146 \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\] The maximum is \\(l^* = l_1\\), and we can go ahead and apply the trick: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nl(11|2,30) & = - A + l^* + \\log \\big ( e^{l_1 - l^*} + e^{l_2 - l^*} + e^{l_3 - l^*}\\big) \\\\\n& = -1.514 + \\log \\big( e^{0} + e^{-0.5978} + e^{-2.726} \\big) \\\\\n& = -1.514 + \\log \\big( 1+ {0.55} + {0.06548} \\big) \\\\\n& = -1.514 + 0.4796 \\\\\n& =  -1.034\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAs expected we get exactly the same result - with the benefit that the largest value we used in any of the sums was \\(A \\approx 26.95\\).\n\n\nProof Given \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n > 0\\), let \\(l_k = \\log(x_k)\\) and \\(l^* = \\max_k l_k\\). Then\n\\[\n\\log(x_1 + \\cdots +  x_n) =  l^* + \\log \\bigg ( \\exp(l_1 - l^*) + \\cdots + \\exp(l_n - l^*)\\bigg)\n\\]\nProof\nThe trick itself follows some from some fairly routine manipulation of exponentials. In the below, we have \\(x_k,\\,l_k\\) defined as above, and let \\(A\\) be any constant:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1 + \\cdots + x_n & = \\exp( \\log x_1) + \\cdots + \\exp( \\log x_n) \\\\\n& = \\exp(l_1) + \\cdots + \\exp(l_n) \\\\\n& = \\exp(A) \\bigg(\\exp(l_1 - A) + \\cdots + \\exp (l_n - A) \\bigg)\n\\end{align*}\n\\] Taking logarithms of both sides\n\\[\\log(x_1 + \\cdots + x_n) = A + \\log \\bigg ( \\exp(l_1 - A) + \\cdots + \\exp(l_n - A)\\bigg),\\] and the trick follows by choosing \\(A = l^* = \\max_k l_k\\).\n\n\nImportantly subtracting the maximum guarantees that each of the terms to be exponentiated satisfies \\(l_k - l^* \\leq 0\\), and hence each exponential is bounded above by 1, avoiding any calculations at the limits of machine precision.\nBååth’s Prior\nRasmus defined his prior on \\(\\rho,\\,\\sigma\\) through the following steps:\nSuppose the total number of socks, \\(\\eta\\), follows a negative binomial distribution: \\(\\eta \\sim \\text{NBinom}(\\mu, \\tau)\\).\nSuppose that the proportion of socks that are in pairs, \\(\\theta\\), follows a beta distribution: \\(\\theta \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)\\).\nCalculate the number of pairs of socks: \\(\\rho = \\left[ \\lfloor \\eta/2 \\rfloor \\theta \\right]\\), where \\(\\lfloor \\, \\cdot \\, \\rfloor\\) denotes the floor, and \\(\\left[ \\, \\cdot \\, \\right]\\) denotes rounding.\nCalculate the number of singleton socks: \\(\\sigma = \\eta - 2\\rho\\).\nFor Rasmus this choice doesn’t create an issues, as its perfectly easy to sample from this prior, and hence to conduct ABC. However as we are looking to do exact Bayesian inference, we have to derive the explicit formula for the prior - and that isn’t trivial. It is doable, but leads to a formula that is not particularly intuitive, which was my motivation for working with the product prior.\n\n\nBååth’s Prior Let \\(P_{\\mu,\\tau} \\sim \\text{NBinom}(\\mu,\\,\\tau)\\) and \\(P_{\\alpha,\\beta} \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)\\) then\\[ P(\\rho, \\sigma) = P_{\\mu, \\tau}(2\\rho + \\sigma) \\left\\{ F_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\left( \\frac{2\\rho + 1}{2 \\lfloor \\rho + \\sigma/2\\rfloor}\\right) - F_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\left( \\frac{2\\rho - 1}{2 \\lfloor \\rho + \\sigma/2\\rfloor}\\right) \\right\\}\\] where \\(F_{\\alpha,\\beta}(t) = P_{\\alpha,\\beta}(\\theta < t)\\) is the CDF of the Beta distribution.\n\n\nProof Let \\(P_{\\mu,\\tau} \\sim \\text{NBinom}(\\mu,\\,\\tau)\\) and \\(P_{\\alpha,\\beta} \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)\\) then\\[ P(\\rho, \\sigma) = P_{\\mu, \\tau}(2\\rho + \\sigma)\\left\\{F_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\left( \\frac{\\rho + \\textstyle \\frac12}{\\lfloor \\rho + \\sigma/2 \\rfloor} \\right) - F_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\left( \\frac{\\rho - \\textstyle \\frac12}{\\lfloor \\rho + \\sigma/2 \\rfloor} \\right)  \\right\\}\\] where \\(F_{\\alpha,\\beta}(t) = P_{\\alpha,\\beta}(\\theta < t)\\) is the CDF of the Beta distribution.\nAn application of the law of total probability gives us:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP(\\rho, \\sigma) & = \\sum_{\\eta} P(\\rho,\\sigma | \\eta) P(\\eta) \\\\\n& = P(\\rho, \\sigma | \\eta = 2\\rho + \\sigma) P(\\eta = 2\\rho + \\sigma) \\\\\n& = P_{\\mu,\\tau}(2\\rho + \\sigma) P(\\rho,\\sigma|\\eta = 2\\rho + \\sigma).\n\\end{align}\n\\] The first term is as in the formula above, so now we focus on the conditional term. For this we note\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP(\\rho,\\sigma | \\eta) & = P\\big( \\big[ \\lfloor \\eta/2 \\rfloor \\theta \\big] = \\rho\\big) \\\\\n & = P_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\big( \\rho - \\textstyle \\frac12 < \\lfloor \\eta/2 \\rfloor \\theta < \\rho + \\textstyle \\frac12 \\big) \\\\\n & = P_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\left( \\frac{\\rho - \\textstyle \\frac12}{\\lfloor \\eta/2 \\rfloor} <  \\theta < \\frac{\\rho - \\textstyle \\frac12}{\\lfloor \\eta/2 \\rfloor} \\right) \\\\\n & = P_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\left( \\frac{\\rho - \\textstyle \\frac12}{\\lfloor \\rho + \\sigma/2 \\rfloor} <  \\theta < \\frac{\\rho - \\textstyle \\frac12}{\\lfloor  \\rho + \\sigma/2 \\rfloor} \\right) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\] The final statement above follows since the CDF satisifes \\(P_{\\alpha,\\beta}(a < \\theta < b) = F_{\\alpha,\\beta}(b) - F_{\\alpha,\\beta}(a)\\).\n\n\nUtility Functions\n\nShow code\n# function to calculate grid of log posterior probabilities.\n#   - if prior_func = NULL returns the likelihood,\n#   - if likelihood_func = NULL returns the prior distribution\ncalculate_sock_grid <- function(rho_max,sigma_max, log_likelihood = NULL, log_prior = NULL){\n    \n  if(is.null(log_likelihood) & is.null(log_prior)){\n    stop(\"At least one of log_likelihood or log_prior must be provided\")\n  }\n\n  # initialise grid\n  grid <- crossing(\n      rho = 0:rho_max,\n      sigma = 0:sigma_max,\n      log_likelihood = NA_real_,\n      log_prior = NA_real_,\n      log_posterior = NA_real_\n    ) %>% rowwise()\n  \n\n  # populate prior/likelihood\n  if(!is.null(log_likelihood)){\n    grid <- grid %>% mutate(log_likelihood = log_likelihood(rho,sigma))\n  }\n  \n  if(!is.null(log_prior)){\n    grid <- grid %>% mutate(log_prior = log_prior(rho,sigma))\n  }\n  \n  # populate posterior, first calculating without the additive constant, Z, then\n  # evaluating this and adding.\n  grid <- grid %>% mutate(prop_log_posterior = log_likelihood + log_prior)\n\n  log_Z <- logSumExp(grid$prop_log_posterior)\n    \n  grid <- grid %>% \n    mutate(log_posterior = -log_Z + prop_log_posterior) %>%\n    select(-prop_log_posterior)\n    \n  # calculate non-log terms\n  grid <- grid %>%\n    mutate(across(starts_with(\"log_\"), ~exp(.), .names = \"exp_{col}\")) %>%\n    rename_with(~str_remove(.,\"exp_log_\"))\n  \n  return(grid)\n}\n\nplot_sock_grid <- function(grid, var){\n  \n  var_name <- rlang::as_name(enquo(var))\n  \n  if(str_detect(var_name, \"log\")){\n    \n    filled_grid <- grid %>% filter(!is.infinite({{var}}))\n    empty_grid <- grid %>% filter(is.infinite({{var}}))\n  } else {\n    filled_grid <- grid %>% filter(({{var}} != 0))\n    empty_grid <- grid %>% filter(({{var}} == 0))\n  }\n  \n  p <- ggplot() +\n    geom_point(data =filled_grid,aes(x = rho, y = sigma, color ={{var}}), size =4) +\n    geom_point(data = empty_grid, aes(x = rho, y = sigma, ), color = \"grey\", shape = 1, size =4) +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,max(grid$rho),by=10)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,max(grid$sigma),by=10)) +\n    scale_color_gradientn(\n      colours = wesanderson::wes_palette(\"Zissou1\", 1000, type = \"continuous\"),\n      name = \"\") +\n    coord_fixed() + \n    labs(x = \"ρ\", y = \"σ\") +\n    theme(\n      axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5),\n      axis.line = element_blank(), legend.key.width = unit(1.4, \"cm\")\n    )\n \n return(p)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I created the animation above to get a better understanding of the shape of the Tour de France.\n\nThe Yellow Jersey was added in 1919, but cheating was an issue from the second edition: the four top placed riders were all later disqualified.\nIn the sections below I’ll summarise what I like about the visualisation and what I think could be improved.\nMaillot Jaune\nThe Maillot Jaune, Yellow Jersey, is famously worn by the rider in the lead of the race at the start of each stage, and finally awarded to the overall fastest rider when the race concludes in Paris.\nThe highlight of the visualisation for me is that it provides a compelling example of the benefits of animation for data story telling: enabling me to draw insights about the race that I’d have struggled to do from tables and static maps alone.\nHere’s a few points that I found interesting.\nThe early editions of the Tour had very few stages\nThe first and second editions of the Tour comprised just 6 stages, compared to today’s 21. Further digging into the data indicates the stage distances were however significantly longer than modern editions.\n\nThe longest stage in the 1903 Tour spanned 471km, compared to a maximum of 250km in 2021.\nA tour of the perimeter?\nThe Tour used to be largely about traversing the outer regions of France: between 1905 and 1938 the only detour away from the boarders seems to be the requisite annual visit to Paris.\nVariation was guaranteed for the riders every few years though, when the race organisers would change their preference for a clockwise or anti-clockwise route.\nThe Missing Years\nThe lack of animation in the periods 1915-1918 and 1940-46 are a reminder of the impact that the First and Second World Wars had on the routines and attractions that we take for granted.\nFurther reading led me to the interesting fact that a 1940 Tour was planned, with the intent that riders would be drafted from soldiers stationed in France.\n\nThere’s a lot more information on the Wikipedia page Tour de France during World War II.\nLate to the Party\nEven into the 1990s its possible to pick out by eye some département that were yet to host the start or finish of a Tour stage. Hosting a tour stage costs and it could well be that these areas of the country had different ideas on how local taxes should be spent.\nPierre Breteau created an app for Le Monde that allows you to explore the frequency that the Tour has passed through each department. With the exception of Corsica (that was finally visited in 2013) and overseas territories, his data indicates that the final department to be visited was Indre in 1992.\nLanterne Rouge\nThe Lanterne Rouge, Red Lantern, is the dubious award given to the last placed rider in the Tour. Somewhat ironically its a title riders fight for as it comes with an offer to ride (and hence appearance fees) in the post-Tour Criterium races.\nThe animation is far from perfect, and could do with some tweaks and improvements - some of which I’ve listed below. Maybe I’ll get around to improving these ahead of Copenhagen 2022!\nStraight Lines, and Pedalo Races\nEvident from the very first frame of the animation is the simplification to straight line paths between stage start and end points. This is particularly stark when the route follows the coast, occasionally suggesting that the riders took to the water to complete the stage.\nA search for Tour de France shapefiles suggests that these don’t exist for public consumption, but detailed road books are published for recent editions of the race - so in theory perhaps more accurate paths could be traced from this data.\nTour de… Belgique?\nWhilst it took until 1992 for the Tour to visit every mainland department, the race first left France in 1947 with detours to both Brussels, and Luxembourg City.\nSince then the tour has made regular detours to nearby countries: for now I’ve removed these overseas excursions for want of a suitable way to incorporate them into the visualisation - but this feels like an easy fix for the future.\n5 of the last 10 Grand Departs have taken place elsewhere in Europe.\nImplausible Locations\nI’ve used geocoding to infer longitude/latitude coordinates from the start/finish location names, using the R tidygeocoder package. This isn’t always accurate, returning for instance Cherbourg, Australia instead of Cherbourg, France, or suggesting the 2010 Tour started at Rue de Rotterdam, Tours rather than Rotterdam in the Netherlands.\nThis leads to some pretty obvious errors in the animation, with implausible distances covered in a stage. An immediate data quality check that could be built in is to calculate the straight line distance between start/end points of a stage and flag if this is greater than the stage distance.\nR Code\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nlibrary(infreqthemes)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(gganimate)\nlibrary(tdfData) # install.github(\"odaniel1/tdfData\")\n\n## ---- prepare stage data --------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# TdF stage data was scraped from Wikipedia; it has some limitations (discussed above).\n# Its available in the tdfData package from my GitHub account\ntdf_stages <-tdf_stages %>% clean_names()\n\n# the TdF did not take place during WWI and WWII; create 'empty' stages so that\n# the animation marks these years.\nmissing_years <- crossing(year = c(1915:1918, 1940:1946), stage = as.character(1:10)) %>%\n  mutate(date = as.Date(paste0(year, \"-07-\",stage), '%Y-%m-%d'))\n\n# add missing years to the data; the stage_no column defines the order for the animation.\ntdf_stages <- bind_rows(tdf_stages, missing_years) %>%\n  arrange(date) %>%\n  mutate(stage_no=1:n())\n\n## ---- prepare plot data ---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# The approach to getting lines to fade in gganimate is adapted from:\n# stackoverflow.com/questions/58271332/gganimate-plot-where-points-stay-and-line-fades\nplot_data <- tdf_stages %>%\n  uncount(nrow(tdf_stages), .id = \"frame\") %>%\n  filter(stage_no <= frame) %>%\n  arrange(frame, stage_no) %>%\n  group_by(frame) %>%\n  mutate(\n    # which edition of the TdF does the current frame visualise?\n    frame_year = max(year),\n    # how many stages ago was the stage first visualised created?\n    tail = last(stage_no) - stage_no,\n    # transparency set to be 1 (full) for first visualiation, and then fade.\n    # size set to be larger within same edition of TdF, and then shrink.\n    point_alpha = if_else(tail == 0, 1, 0.7),\n    point_size = if_else(year == frame_year, 2, 1),\n    # Fade lines over 20 stages, and remove once a new edition of the TdF starts.\n    segment_alpha = pmax(0, (20-tail)/20) * (year == frame_year)\n  ) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n## ---- create plot ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# raw (non-animated) plot\np <- ggplot(plot_data) +\n  \n  # used to dynamically add the edition of the TdF\n  geom_text(\n    data=plot_data, aes(-4, 50.5, label = frame_year),\n    size = 12, hjust = 0, color =infreq_palette[\"darkblue\"]\n  ) +\n  \n  # background map of france (coord_map fixes the aspect ratio)\n  geom_polygon(\n    data = map_data(\"france\"), aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group),\n    fill = \"#f3be02\", color = \"#f6f4e6\", size = 0.1\n  ) +\n  coord_map() +\n  \n  # stage start and finish locations as points\n  geom_point(\n    aes(x=start_longitude,y=start_latitude, alpha = point_alpha),\n    size = plot_data$point_size\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(x=finish_longitude,y=finish_latitude,group=stage_no, alpha = point_alpha),\n    size = plot_data$point_size\n  ) +\n  \n  # line segment connecting stage start/finish points.\n  geom_segment(\n    aes(\n      x=start_longitude,\n      xend=finish_longitude,\n      y=start_latitude,\n      yend=finish_latitude,\n      alpha = segment_alpha\n    ), color = infreq_palette[\"orange\"]\n  ) +\n  \n  # set themes and legend\n  scale_alpha(range = c(0,1)) +\n  guides(alpha = \"none\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  transition_manual(frame)\n\n# create animation; speed is set to display 10 stages per second; completes in ~4mins.\nanim_stages <- animate(p,\n  nframes = max(plot_data$frame),\n  duration = max(tdf_stages$stage_no) * 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\nAcknowledgments\nI first became interested in visualising how the Tour de France had changed over time after coming across Pierre Breteau’s visualisation in Le Monde, which shows the frequency with which each département of France has been visited by the race.\nTo create the data set I’m indebted to the contributors to Wikipedia for their efforts to tabulate all of the stages in the Tour’s history.\nTo obtain and visualise the data I relied heavily on R, and and in particular the work of the creators of the rvest, gganimate, and tidygeocoder packages.\n\n\n\n",
